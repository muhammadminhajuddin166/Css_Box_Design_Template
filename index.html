    <p id="p2">Respected Sir,</p>

    <p>I am a student of <span class="highlight">Batch 17</span> in the Web and App Development course. I would like to bring to your kind attention that although there is a water dispenser installed in the auditorium, it usually does not have a water bottle attached.</p>
    <p>Due to this, students are unable to get drinking water during class hours, and going outside to drink water often causes disturbance and distraction. Since the weather is quite hot, staying hydrated is important for everyoneâ€™s health and focus.</p>
    <p>I respectfully request that a water bottle be arranged and regularly replaced in the dispenser, so that students can have easy access to drinking water during class.</p>


    <p>Thank you.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,<br>
